# Traditional Knowledge Compilation
Included is all data analysis conducted for the Fall 2021-Summer 2022 Traditional Knowledge Project. 

This research observes the connection between cultural and indigenous knowledge from two villages in Zimbabwe, Karoi and Ndambe, and climate change mitigation strategies. The overarching goal is to empower indigenous belief systems through the validation of traditional thought while also highlighting the ways in which empirical sciences can be linked to non-traditional adaptation programming.
